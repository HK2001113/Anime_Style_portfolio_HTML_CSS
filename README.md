# portfolio_HTML-CSS
 I am excited to present my newly created portfolio project, designed to showcase my skills and expertise in HTML and CSS. This project serves as a digital representation of my abilities, highlighting my commitment to clean, responsive design and user-friendly interfaces. This portfolio is crafted exclusively using HTML and CSS, ensuring a lightweight and efficient website. Each element has been meticulously designed to reflect my style and attention to detail. Throughout the project, I have incorporated various CSS animations and effects to enhance the user experience and make the site visually engaging. It's important to note that while I have created original content for this portfolio, some of the CSS animations and effects were inspired by other projects showcased on YouTube. I have referenced and adapted these techniques to learn and improve my own skills, showcasing the power of community and shared knowledge in the web development field. I invite you to explore my portfolio and witness the culmination of my work. Your feedback and suggestions are most welcome as I continue to grow and evolve as a developer.
